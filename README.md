# Python-Projects

These are a few small Python Projects I've done for fun, nothing too big or important should be in this repository.
Many of these files including h.py, pythonEx.py and name.py are small programs used in the summer program I developed to teach elementary school kids to use python.
Others like crediCard.py and Validate.py were made to test large input handling and data validation respectively.
